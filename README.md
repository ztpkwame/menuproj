# Menu designs

*** Menu 1 *** <br>
The design approach for this is to use bootstrap's dropdown menu along with a custom css to create a mega menu. Mimicking the main project design so its easy to implement if its chosen. This design removes the need of the left hand sidebar on the main site, since the functionality of that part will be added into the menu.


*** Menu 2 *** <br>
This design takes a slighly different aproach by keeping the same navbar menu but removing the left-hand sidebar and making it more like a left slider toggle which opens when its clicked. 


Goal: To make the main frame design more rich in terms of ui and easy to use.
